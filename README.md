# OMEGA

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
Omega connects fishers, sellers, and buyers. Fishers can find fishing spots using weather data, sell their catch, and use a map for navigation. Sellers can trade fishing tools and seafood. Visitors can browse and buy seafood. Omega simplifies fishing, trading, and seafood discovery in one platform.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
